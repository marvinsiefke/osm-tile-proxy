# pepper-osmproxy
pepper-osmproxy is a smart and lightweight proxy with caching for OpenStreetMap tile servers.

## Usage
This script runs even on shared hosting environments. It does not have any specific requirements other than needing a newer PHP version. The rewrite rules in the .htaccess file adapt the typical URL schema for tile servers on this proxy: https://proxy.domain.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.png

## Features
- Simple file caching
- IP and session based rate limiting
- Privacy friendly handling
- Error logging (if PHP Error logs are enabled)

## Configuration
