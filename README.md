# pepper-osmproxy
pepper-osmproxy is a smart and lightweight proxy with caching for OpenStreetMap tile servers.

## Usage
This script runs even on shared hosting environments. It does not have any specific requirements other than needing a newer PHP version with curl. The rewrite rules in the .htaccess file adapt the typical URL schema for tile servers on this proxy: https://proxy.domain.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.png

## Features
- Privacy friendly handling (allows a GDPR-compliant usage of OpenStreetMap without an own tileserver)
- Simple file caching
- Anonymized IP and session based rate limiting
- Access control with maxBounds, maxZoom and minZoom (equivalent to Leaflet)
- Error logging (if PHP Error logs are enabled)
- Asynchronous tile update via cronjob

## Configuration

According to the ToS of the openstreetmap.org tile server, it is strongly recommended to provide the email address of the administrator in the config.php. You can also define trusted hosts.

### Options
- **`$config['operator']` Required according to the ToS of the openstreetmap.org Tileserver:** The email address of the administrator.
- `$config['trustedHosts']` An array of domains that are trusted as proxy hosts. The host can be optionally limitated with allowed `referers` (checks if it matches if the client/browser exposes a referer) or a specific area `maxBounds` (equivalent to Leaflet). Furthermore you can set `minZoom` and `maxZoom`. Default: empty (all hosts allowed, no limitations).
- `$config['cron']` Allows running `cron.php` via cli that updates tiles from the queue in the background.
- `$config['browserTtl']` The time to live of the tiles in the browser cache. Default: 86400 * 7 sec. (7 days).
- `$config['tileservers']` The tileservers with url and ttl. 
- `$config['tolerance']` expands the maximum bounds for tile requests by a small degree to account for rounding errors and ensure all necessary tiles are fetched.
- `$config['storage']` The directory of the file cache. Default: `tmp/`
- `$config['ratelimits']` The options for the rate limiter: `durationInterval` The interval during which the hits are counted (Default: 60 seconds). `durationHardBan` The duration for any hard bans, e.g., in case of too many soft bans or invalid arguments (Default: 21600 seconds). `maxHits` The allowed number of provided tiles per interval. (Default: 1500 hits). `maxSoftBans` The allowed number of soft bans (Default: 50 soft bans).

Please have a look at the config.php. This documentation is miserable, I will explain some things better soon.

## Planned features
- Vector tile support when the tileservers are ready :) According to the official osm blog it's already the year of the OpenStreetMap vector maps, so letÂ´s see...
